## =Ý Video Script

### SEGMENT 1: Hook & Introduction (30 seconds)
**[Camera close-up, then transition to screen]**

```
"What if I told you that you could qualify 200 leads per day,
reduce your cost per lead from $40 to 21 cents, and never
miss another call - even at 2 AM?

Sound impossible?

Hi, I'm [Your Name] from ResultantAI, and in the next
8 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how MCA lenders
are using AI voice agents to 10x their lead processing
capacity while cutting costs by 99%.

Let's dive in."
```

**[Actions]**:
- Smile and maintain eye contact
- Speak with energy and enthusiasm
- Transition to screen share showing demo homepage

---

### SEGMENT 2: The Problem (1 minute)
**[Screen: Scroll slowly down homepage to "BEFORE" stats]**

```
"If you're running an MCA business, you know the challenges:

[Point cursor to each stat]

Every lead qualification takes 15 to 20 minutes of your
team's time. That's a lot of expensive labor.

Each qualified lead costs you $35 to $50 when you factor
in salaries, benefits, and overhead.

Your team can only handle about 20 to 25 leads per day.
That's your ceiling - you can't scale without hiring more
people.

And here's the killer: After 6 PM and on weekends? Zero
coverage. You're missing 30 to 40 percent of your inbound
calls.

[Pause for effect]

But what if there was a better way?"
```

**[Actions]**:
- Use cursor to highlight each stat as you mention it
- Circle the "0%" after-hours coverage
- Speak with empathy - these are real pain points

---

### SEGMENT 3: The Solution (1 minute)
**[Screen: Scroll to "AFTER" stats]**

```
"This is what happens when you deploy an AI voice agent:

[Point to each stat]

Qualification time drops to 2-3 minutes. The AI asks the
right questions, extracts the data, and makes routing
decisions instantly.

Cost per lead? 21 cents. Yes, you heard that right - from
$40 to 21 cents.

Daily capacity? 200-plus leads. No hiring, no training,
no management overhead. It just scales.

And after-hours coverage? 100 percent. The AI never sleeps,
never takes a vacation, never calls in sick.

[Pause]

Let me show you how this actually works in real conversations."
```

**[Actions]**:
- Highlight each improvement with cursor
- Use hand gestures to emphasize the dramatic differences
- Build excitement in your voice

---

### SEGMENT 4: Live Demo - Scenario 1 (2 minutes)
**[Screen: Click on first scenario - Qualified Restaurant Owner]**

```
"Let's listen to a real conversation. This is a restaurant
owner calling about MCA funding.

[Play audio - if added, or narrate]

Notice a few things here:

[Pause audio or use visual callouts]

First, the AI builds rapport immediately. 'Thanks for your
interest' - warm, professional, human-like.

Second, it asks qualifying questions naturally. Not a rigid
script - it flows like a real conversation.

Third, it's extracting key data points:
- Business type: Italian Restaurant
- Monthly revenue: $85,000 - well above the threshold
- Time in business: 3 years - qualified
- Funding amount: $50,000 - perfect range

[Show qualification result]

Boom. Qualified lead. The AI instantly routes this to your
sales team with all the data pre-populated in your CRM.

Your sales rep gets a text notification, sees the full
qualification details, and can call back in 2 minutes
while the lead is still hot.

This entire process took 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Your
manual team would've spent 18 minutes on this."
```

**[Actions]**:
- Play scenario audio or show conversation flow
- Use cursor to highlight key points
- Emphasize the speed and accuracy
- Show enthusiasm when revealing the qualification result

---

### SEGMENT 5: Live Demo - Scenario 2 (1.5 minutes)
**[Screen: Click on second scenario - Unqualified Lead]**

```
"Now, not every lead qualifies. Let's see how the AI handles
rejection professionally.

[Play/show conversation]

This is a new coffee shop - only 4 months in business.
Revenue is just $12,000 per month. Below our thresholds.

Watch how the AI handles this:

[Highlight key phrases]

'I appreciate your interest...'
'At this time, we typically work with businesses that have
been operating for at least 6 months...'
'I'd love to follow up with you in a couple of months...'

Professional. Empathetic. Leaves the door open for future
business.

And here's the magic: This lead is automatically added to
a 2-month nurture campaign. When they hit 6 months, they'll
get a follow-up call.

[Pause]

Your team didn't waste 15 minutes on an unqualified lead,
but you didn't burn the relationship either. That's smart
automation."
```

**[Actions]**:
- Show how AI maintains professionalism
- Highlight the nurture campaign feature
- Emphasize the time savings on unqualified leads

---

### SEGMENT 6: ROI Breakdown (1.5 minutes)
**[Screen: Scroll to stats comparison or show calculator]**

```
"Let's talk about what this means for your bottom line.

Say you're processing 100 leads per day right now.

Current cost: 100 leads times $40 equals $4,000 per day.
That's $120,000 per month in qualification costs alone.

With AI: 100 leads times 21 cents equals $21 per day.
That's $630 per month.

[Let this sink in]

You're saving $119,370 every single month. That's almost
$1.4 million per year.

But wait - there's more.

[Point to capacity increase]

Your team can only handle 25 leads per day, max. The AI
can handle 200-plus.

That means you can process 175 additional leads every day
without adding a single employee.

If even 20 percent of those additional leads convert, and
your average deal is $50,000, that's...

[Calculate on screen or in your head]

175 leads × 30 days × 20% conversion × $50,000 average deal
= $52.5 million in additional monthly funding volume.

Your revenue share on that? Game changing."
```

**[Actions]**:
- Use cursor or calculator to show math
- Speak slowly on the big numbers - let them register
- Build excitement as you reveal the revenue opportunity
- Pause after major reveals

---

### SEGMENT 7: Implementation & Timeline (1 minute)
**[Screen: Can show deployment guide or just speak to camera]**

```
"Now you might be thinking: 'This sounds great, but isn't
AI complicated to implement?'

Not at all. Here's the typical timeline:

Week 1: Discovery call. We analyze your current process,
understand your qualification criteria, and map out
integration with your CRM.

Week 2-3: Configuration. We train the AI on your specific
business rules, set up the voice agent, and integrate with
your systems. You review and approve.

Week 4: Pilot launch. We start with 20 percent of your
leads for 2 weeks. Monitor, measure, optimize.

Week 6: Full rollout. Scale to 100 percent of leads.

From first call to full deployment: 6 weeks.

Most clients see positive ROI within the first 2 weeks of
the pilot.

[Pause]

And we handle the heavy lifting. Your team just needs to
provide the business rules and system access."
```

**[Actions]**:
- Speak with confidence about the process
- Emphasize the short timeline
- Address concerns before they arise

---

### SEGMENT 8: Social Proof (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Can show case study or testimonial if available]**

```
"Don't just take my word for it.

Premier Capital Solutions implemented this 3 months ago.
They were processing 50 leads per day manually.

Results:
- 300 percent increase in lead capacity
- 98 percent cost reduction
- 45 percent improvement in qualification accuracy
- Sales team now focuses on closing, not qualifying

FastFund MCA was missing 40 percent of after-hours calls.
Now? Zero missed calls. 60 percent increase in qualified
leads. $250,000 in additional monthly funding volume.

Their COO told me: 'We got our investment back in 2 weeks.
This is the best technology decision we've ever made.'
